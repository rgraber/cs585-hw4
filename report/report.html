<h2> Problem Definition </h2>
<p>
  The goal of this assignment was to segment and track a group of eels and crabs in a tank. The idea was to provide image data that could then be used to analyze the animals' behavior throughout the course of an experiment. This data is useful for marine biologists and others studying these animals, as it prevents them from potentially having to watch several hours of footage and manually track the behavior.</p>
<p>
  This assignment assumes the input is taken from the same eel/crab tank as was provided in the assignment. Our segmenting method relies heavily on the known setup of the room/tank (white walls, 2 tanks side by side, water line about halfway up the tank, etc.). Moreover, it assumes the background remains relatively constant so the animals are the only things consistently moving. 
</p>
<p>
  Among the many difficulties of this project was tracking two animals with very different styles of movement. The crabs generally moved very slowly, even staying completely still for extended periods of time. The eels, however, moved very rapidly throughout the scene, often resulting in huge differences in brightness across their bodies as the light hit different parts of their bodies at different angles. We also ran into several difficulties when people came into the room and adjusted the light, creating the illusion of motion in the image.
  </p>

<h2> Method and Implementation </h2>
<p>Our methodology was as follows:
  <ol>
    <li>Create a background mask by locating the two tanks and removing everything else
    <ul>Relevant Functions:
      <li>createMatchedMask(imgFile, templateFile, mask)</li>
      </ul></li>
    <li>Create a history mask by taking the pixel-by-pixel mean intensity for the previous ten frames
    <li>OTHER THINGS I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND</li>
    <li>Taking the skeleton of each segment
      <ul>Relevant Functions:
	<li>skeletonize(src,dest,obj_id)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>For each identified segment, calculating the angle of orientation to determine the probable direction of motion and using the orientation to determine the "front" and "back" of the skeleton and marking the relevant pixels as head and tail. If the angle of orientation was between pi/4 and 3pi/4, the eel was determined to be moving up or down (as opposed to left/right). In order to determine the probable direction of motion, the centroid of the skeleton was compared with the previous centroid. If the object was perceived to be moving up, the highest point on the skeleton was identified as the head, and the lowest was identified as the tail. The head,tail, and centroid were then recorded for future comparison.
  <ul>Relevant Functions:
    <li>orientation(object)</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
<li>Add frame to history mask
  <ul>Relevant Functions:
    <li>mergeHistory(history,dst)</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

</p>

<h2>Experiments</h2>
<p>We tried several methods to improve object tracking before settling on the implementation described above. We began by using opencv's background subtraction method, but the results were very noisy and difficult to process. Even mixing the results of opencv's method with some basic thresholding failed to produce clean segmentation. Another experiment we tried was using flood fill after we had found an initial segment to fill it out and get more of the eel. However, the close similarity between the eels and the white background meant the flood filling expanded the segments too much.

<h2> Discussion </h2>

<p> 
Discuss your method and results:
<ul>
<li>What are the strengths and weaknesses of your method? </li>
<li>Do your results show that your method is generally successful or
     are there limitations? Describe what you expected to find in your
     experiments, and how that differed or was confirmed by your
     results. </li>
<li>Potential future work. How could your method be improved?   What
would you try (if you had more time) to overcome the
failures/limitations of your work?</li> 
</ul>
</p>

<h2> Conclusions </h2>

<p>
Based on your discussion, what are your conclusions?  What is your
main message?

<h2> Credits and Bibliography </h2>
<p>

Cite any papers or other references you consulted while developing
your solution.  Citations to papers should include the authors, the
year of publication, the title of the work, and the publication
information (e.g., book name and publisher; conference proceedings and
location; journal name, volume and pages; technical report and
institution).  Material on the web should include the url and date of
access.
